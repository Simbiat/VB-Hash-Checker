# VB-Hash-Checker
This code is to be used in conjunction with [Hash Updater](https://github.com/Simbiat/VB-Hash-Updater). It uses the hashlists generated by it and validates the files, logging everything and reporting mismatches using my [HTA Logger](https://github.com/Simbiat/HTA-Logging). It also uses a status bar (same as can be found in [HTA Launcher](https://github.com/Simbiat/HTA-Launcher)).
